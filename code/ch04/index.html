            <h3>From the Blog</h3>
            <p><strong>Nov 4</strong> &mdash; RPM is gearing up for the holiday season and stocking up on lots of records for the post-Thanksgiving LP rush. We should be flush with inventory and we suspect that we'll have some cool new specials to announce later in the month. Check back soon for the holiday RPM madness.</p>
            <p><strong>Oct 20</strong> &mdash; We just received a mysterious package in our warehouse full of Christmas albums that seem to have originated in Japan. We are currently investigating their origins and if everything checks out, we'll have them up on the site for purchase. Could be the makings of an RPM Music exclusive.</p>
            <p><strong>Oct 7</strong> &mdash; New specials are up on on the site as of last night. Be sure to check out the LP's that offer free shipping.</p>
